/* A square of squares
You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vain… Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

Task
Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

Examples
-1  =>  false
 0  =>  true
 3  =>  false
 4  =>  true
25  =>  true
26  =>  false

square = (n) => {
    let i = 0;
    let val = false;
    while (i <= n && n >= 0) {
        
        if (n == i^2 && n == i * i) {
            val = true; 
            n = -1;    // to break the loop  
        }
        else {
            i++;
            val = false;  
       }            
    } 
    return val;  
}
output = (square(-1));
console.log(output);
output = (square(0));
console.log(output);
output = square(3);

console.log(output);
